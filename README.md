# **ASSISTANCE LIST**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is a very useful web app to take note of assistance at construction sites. It uses Firebase to store the info and allows to enter the worked hours for each day of the week. Two tables are related; 'Trabajadores' table keeps record of all the workers that will be taken assistance from, and 'Lista de rayas' table keeps the assistance list itself. Functionality to keep consistancy in the input form was added, along with 'edition mode' to fixed mistyped info as well 'deletion' option. Automatic operations were added to calculate the worker weekly payment according to the input data.
